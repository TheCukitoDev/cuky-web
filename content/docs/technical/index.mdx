## What is a vector database?

You can think of a vector database as a database that **doesn't store the raw** data as a SQL or NoSQL database would do because it stores the **_qualities of the data_**.
These qualities are called **embeddings** and are represented as vectors (hence the name vector database).

In the **example above**, you can see the different steps of ingesting data on a vector database. Those are:

1. Data is collected from various sources (e.g., text, images, audio).
2. The data is processed and transformed into embeddings using a suitable model (e.g., a neural network).
3. The embeddings are stored in the vector database, allowing for efficient similarity search and retrieval.
4. When the data is queried, the vector database retrieves the most similar embeddings based on the query vector.

## What is an embedding?

An embedding is a numerical representation of data in a space. You can think of it as a way of classifying the data based on its features. Think of an image: a picture of a dog and a cat will have different embeddings based on their visual characteristics.

In a vector database, embeddings are used to represent the data points, allowing for efficient similarity search and retrieval. When a query is made, the vector database compares the query embedding with the stored embeddings to find the most similar ones.

## How are embeddings generated?

[Embeddings](#what-is-an-embedding) are typically generated using machine learning models, such as neural networks. These models are trained on large datasets to learn the underlying patterns and features of the data.

Some popular models for generating embeddings include:

- [Word2Vec](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/word2vec)
- [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
- [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/)
- [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert)
- [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP)

## Usage differences between a vector database and a traditional database

When you think of a traditional database, you might think of a SQL or NoSQL database that stores structured data in tables or documents.

Both types are designed to handle different types of use cases. Traditional databases excel at handling structured data and complex queries, while vector databases are optimized for similarity search and unstructured data.

In summary, if your application requires advanced search capabilities and deals with unstructured data, a vector database may be the better choice. On the other hand, if you need to manage structured data with complex relationships, a traditional database would be more suitable.
