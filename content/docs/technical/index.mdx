## What is a vector database?

A vector database is a type of database designed to store and manage vector embeddings, which are numerical representations of data points in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings are typically generated by machine learning models and are used to capture the semantic meaning of the data.

Vector databases are optimized for similarity search and retrieval tasks, making them ideal for applications such as recommendation systems, image and video search, and natural language processing.

## Mermaid diagram

```tsx ts2js title="Layout.tsx"
import { ReactNode } from "react";

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}
```

### Another code

```rust title="main.rs" icon="rust"
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

<Tabs items={["Javascript", "Rust"]}>
  <Tab value="Javascript">Javascript is weird</Tab>
  <Tab value="Rust">Rust is fast</Tab>
</Tabs>
